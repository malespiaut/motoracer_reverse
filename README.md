# motoracer_reverse

My reverse engineering effort of all the files of the video game Moto Racer.

This repo contains Python tools that aims to convert Moto Racer's proprietary
file formats to open file formats.

This repo only focuses on files of the PC version, but pull requests are welcome
if you write code that supports the Playstation files.

## Coding style

The tools aims to be simple to use and maintain.
I could go overboard and add a proper arguments parser, as well as a `print_usage()`
function in my tools, but “perfect is the enemy of good”, and a simple 200 SLOC
script that is clean enough and does the job is better than an intimidating
overengineered mess.

## License

All code under the Unlicense, which is no more no less than the public domain.

You are free to credit Marc-Alexandre Espiaut if you wish.
